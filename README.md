They receive the money (less a transaction fee) only if they reach or exceed that minimum; otherwise, no money changes hands.The table includes 4115 lines nd 20 columns.

### Purpose
The aim of the project is to analyse the outcomes of the fundraising beased on their launch date and goals separetly

## Analysis and Challenges
Th anayses of the first table reveals that while the number of successful outcomes was 839, this figure for failed and cancelled was 493 and 37 respectively. As for the the second table,it is clear that the percentage of success is higher when the goal is lower, and there is an indirect correlation bewtween them. Here, we have to be careful with the equal sign when introducing the categories, as not considering them will disorganize our calculations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analyses clearly depicts that while the rate of success is much higher in May, this proportion reaches its lowest levels in Dec.Similarly, the graph indicates that the rate of canceled has been steady throughout the year

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The grapg clearly represents that there is an inverse correlation between the golas and the outcomes.The highe the goal is , the higher the rate of canceled and failed outcomes will become.
